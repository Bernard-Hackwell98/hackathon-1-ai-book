# ROS 2 Module Planning

## Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response

```
Successfully completed the implementation planning for the ROS 2 for Humanoid Robotics Module. The planning included:

1. Setup and context loading
2. Technical context definition with specific technologies
3. Constitution compliance verification
4. Project structure definition
5. Phase 0 research with decisions on ROS 2 distribution, Docusaurus configuration, simulation environment, assessment methods, and code standards
6. Phase 1 design with data models for ROS 2 Architecture, Communication Primitives, and URDF Model
7. API contract definition for educational content
8. Quickstart guide for developers
9. Agent context update with new technologies
10. Post-design constitution check

All artifacts generated and stored in specs/001-ros2-humanoid-module/
```

## Outcome

Completed comprehensive planning for the ROS 2 educational module, including research, design, and setup artifacts.

## Evaluation

The planning phase successfully addressed all requirements from the feature specification and ensured compliance with the project constitution. All necessary artifacts have been created for the next phase (task breakdown).
