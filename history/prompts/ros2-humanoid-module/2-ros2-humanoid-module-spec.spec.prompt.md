# ROS 2 Humanoid Module Spec

## Prompt

```
Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) Target audience: Senior undergraduate / graduate students in AI, robotics, or computer science with basic Python knowledge. Module focus: Introduce ROS 2 as the middleware "nervous system" for humanoid robots, enabling communication between AI agents and physical controllers. Chapters to produce (Docusaurus): Chapter 1: Introduction to ROS 2 for Humanoid Robotics - What ROS 2 is and why it is essential for Physical AI - ROS 2 architecture overview (nodes, executors, DDS) - Why ROS 2 over ROS 1 for real-time humanoid systems - How middleware enables embodied intelligence Chapter 2: ROS 2 Communication Primitives - Nodes, topics, services, and actions - Message passing and real-time considerations - Python-based ROS 2 nodes using rclpy - Conceptual examples of AI agents publishing decisions to robot controllers Chapter 3: Robot Modeling with URDF - Purpose of URDF in humanoid robotics - Links, joints, sensors, and coordinate frames - Modeling a simplified humanoid robot - How URDF connects simulation, control, and perception
```

## Response

```
Successfully created the feature specification for the ROS 2 for Humanoid Robotics Module. The specification includes:

- Three user stories covering the three chapters of the module
- Functional requirements for the educational content
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes
- A quality checklist that has been validated

The specification covers:
1. Introduction to ROS 2 for Humanoid Robotics (P1 priority)
2. ROS 2 Communication Primitives (P2 priority) 
3. Robot Modeling with URDF (P3 priority)

The specification is ready for the next phase (planning).
```

## Outcome

Created a comprehensive feature specification for the ROS 2 for Humanoid Robotics educational module, including user stories, requirements, and success criteria.

## Evaluation

The specification successfully captures the educational objectives for teaching ROS 2 to students in AI, robotics, or computer science. It addresses all three required chapters and includes measurable success criteria. The specification is ready for the planning phase.
