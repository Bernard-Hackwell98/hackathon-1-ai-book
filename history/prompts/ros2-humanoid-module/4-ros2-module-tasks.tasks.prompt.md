# ROS 2 Module Tasks

## Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response

```
Successfully generated the tasks.md file for the ROS 2 for Humanoid Robotics Module. The tasks are organized in phases:

1. Phase 1: Setup (project initialization)
2. Phase 2: Foundational (blocking prerequisites)
3. Phase 3: User Story 1 - Introduction to ROS 2 for Humanoid Robotics (P1 priority)
4. Phase 4: User Story 2 - ROS 2 Communication Primitives (P2 priority)
5. Phase 5: User Story 3 - Robot Modeling with URDF (P3 priority)
6. Phase 6: Integration & Cross-Cutting Concerns

The tasks follow the required format with checkboxes, IDs, story labels where appropriate, and specific file paths. Each user story is organized to be independently implementable and testable. Parallel execution opportunities are marked with [P] tags.
```

## Outcome

Generated comprehensive task list for implementing the ROS 2 educational module with proper organization and dependencies.

## Evaluation

The tasks.md file successfully organizes the implementation work into phases aligned with user stories from the specification. Each task follows the required format and includes specific file paths. The dependencies and parallel execution opportunities are clearly identified.
